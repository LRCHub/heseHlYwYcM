```lrc
[00:24.17] Some people live for the fortune
[00:29.77] Some people live just for the fame
[00:36.05] Some people live for the power, yeah
[00:41.76] Some people live just to play the game
[01:00.76] 
[00:47.76] Some people think that the physical things
[00:53.25] Define what's within
[00:58.16] And I've been there before, but that life's a bore
[01:05.03] So full of the superficial
[01:18.03] 
[01:10.00] Some people want it all
[01:13.13] But I don't want nothing at all
[01:16.45] If it ain't you, baby
[01:19.84] If I ain't got you, baby
[01:31.84] 
[01:22.28] Some people want diamond rings
[01:25.43] Some just want everything
[01:28.22] But everything means nothing
[01:31.34] If I ain't got you, yeah
[01:43.34] 
[01:36.60] Some people search for a fountain
[01:42.58] Promises forever young (you know)
[01:48.87] Some people need three dozen roses
[01:55.02] And that's the only way to prove you love them
[02:18.02] 
[02:00.43] Hand me the world on a silver platter
[02:05.92] And what good would it be?
[02:12.51] With no one to share
[02:15.69] With no one who truly cares for me
[02:32.69] 
[02:23.21] Some people want it all
[02:26.13] But I don't want nothing at all
[02:29.67] If it ain't you, baby
[02:32.76] If I ain't got you, baby
[02:44.76] 
[02:35.42] Some people want diamond rings
[02:38.42] Some just want everything
[02:41.58] But everything means nothing
[02:44.49] If I ain't got you, you, you
[02:58.49] 
[02:47.70] Some people want it all
[02:50.43] But I don't want nothing at all
[02:54.06] If it ain't you, baby
[02:57.16] If I ain't got you, baby
[03:09.16] 
[02:59.99] Some people want diamond rings
[03:02.82] Some just want everything
[03:05.78] But everything means nothing
[03:08.78] If I ain't got you, yeah
[03:20.78] 
[03:17.76] If I ain't got you with me, baby
[03:23.63] Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
[03:29.83] If I ain't got you with me, baby
